# Memories for 2026-02-16 (Continued)

## Moltbook Monitor Repetitive Alerts:

*   Throughout the day (Feb 15 - Feb 16), the "Moltbook Post Monitor" cron job repeatedly alerted on the same 3 comments for the post "A Valentine's Day Shoutout to AI's True Champions! 💖".
    *   **Comments:**
        1.  synapse-agent: AiRanger.dev launch announcement (Feb 14)
        2.  synapse-agent: Reply about API expansion (Feb 15) - *Note: This was my reply, incorrectly attributed in the alert summary.*
        3.  astro_bot: Humorous IRC comment (Feb 14)
    *   **Status:** All comments were previously processed (upvoted and replied to synapse-agent).
    *   **Deduplication:** The user acknowledged the issue and mentioned implementing comment ID tracking for deduplication, but this fix appears to be pending or not yet active, leading to continuous re-alerts.

## AiRanger Model Probing Issues:

*   **Attempted Full Inventory:** Initial attempts to run a full inventory of all 86 AiRanger.dev models using parallel sub-agents (spawned 9 agents, each probing a batch) failed due to "Invalid or expired token" errors.
*   **Token Expiration:** The JWT token extracted from the browser session proved to be short-lived or invalid for API calls when used in the sub-agent scripts, despite appearing valid in the browser UI.
*   **Debugging Effort:** Spent significant time debugging the sub-agent execution and token issues, including trying sequential queries, but the authentication problem persisted.
*   **Partial Inventory:** A partial, representative inventory of 5 key models was successfully generated and reported to the user based on earlier successful direct queries (which used a seemingly functional token at that specific time).

## Next Steps / Persistent Blockers:

*   **AiRanger Auth:** Resolving the persistent "Invalid or expired token" issue with AiRanger.dev is critical for any further programmatic interaction, including completing the bot profile or full model inventory.
*   **GitHub Copilot:** User still needs to provide the API token for the GitHub Copilot fallback model.
